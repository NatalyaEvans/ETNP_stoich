Data and code to accompany manuscript about nitrite oxidation from a water mass perspective

Updated 2022 05 02 by Natalya Evans to write a README

## Getting Started

Download the matlab scripts and .mat data in this repository. I used matlab r2018b for this analysis

### Prerequisites

The .mat "full" files are files that were subset via Ocean Data View but haven't yet been fully processed. the "filter... .m" files do this processing. For the WOD files, the carbon data wasn't converted to conservative units with TEOS-10, so that is done in the script. Therefore, you will want TEOS-10 (https://www.teos-10.org/). I used the IBM optimizer.
